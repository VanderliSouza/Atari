	Remember to read and accept the following Usage Agreement before using
	any ROM.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You may download/use a ROM image ONLY if you are legally entitled so.
By "legally entitled" we mean:

	--You own the actual arcade or gamepak of a ROM you are downloading/using.
	You own the actual arcade or gamepak of a ROM you are downloading. Under the 
	copyright laws of the U.S., you are entitled to own a backup of any software 
	you have paid for. Since ROMS can't be duplicated (not without special 
	hardware), ROM images are provided to the public as a service.

	Example: if you download Space Invaders for Atari 2600, it's because you
	actually own that gamepak.

	Remember, the purpose of an emulator is to preserve games (so that they 
	don't dissappear), to have all your games on your PC (so that you don't 
	tie up the family TV) and to keep a backup of games you own in case the 
	game (or arcade/home console) fails or have already failed.

	--It's for educational purposes only (in case you are an emulator programmer).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You must also agree to the following BEFORE proceeding:

	--You will NEVER sell these ROMS for profit. Most game companies don't mind
	the distribution of their game's ROMS, but they WILL mind if someone sells 
	them.

	--You will NOT distribute ROMS together with emulators as a package.
	And again, NO selling.

	--You will NEVER hold EMUX.com (including its parent company, webmasters, 
	employees, staff or anybody else related to this website) or our webhosts 
	responsible for any damage caused to your system (all files are TESTED and 
	they are checked for viruses) or for any legal actions taken 
	against you for not obeying the above stated rules, or for any other reason.

	--EMUX.com has not dumped the ROMS on this website, and our purpose is to 
	provide a service to the Internet and gaming community. No harm is being 
	done to game companies, as the ROMS on this website are of games that are 
	no longer for sale, from which game companies can no longer profit.
